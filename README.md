The python project was used to generate 
the ***data.txt*** file, which the DML SQL file 
uses to populate the database.

It is a JSON parser that extracts the data
needed as outlined by the assignment from IMDB using IMDBot.

The ***list.JSON*** file contains the IMDB ids of the top 100 movies on IMDB,
which the parser program extracts and uses to perform the needed API calls.
It was extracted from the page source of the following webpage: ***https://www.imdb.com/list/ls091520106/***

<h3>Important:</h3>
* The JSON parser script I wrote will not work without the ***list.JSON*** file.
* If you want to test the JSON parser, delete the data.txt if it already exists, or move it to a different folder.
